Svnlib TODO list. Very rough!

+ = todo
X = done

  + Finish implementing all the svn subcommands and opts!

  + Implement a caching mechanism. One approach would be creating a class that
    implements ArrayAccess as a frontend to give the outward appearance of a
    seamless array with all the accumulated results from a particular command.
  
  X Make config dir handling more intelligent.
  
  + Devise some approach to handling the differences between svn 1.4 and 1.5

  + Implement a checking system that ensures some opts are passed when failure
    to pass those opts will result in a hang - such as failing to pass a message
    to the a commit.

  + Get (some of) the global-level svn commands attached nicely to the
    SvnInstance classes.

  + Include (optionally?) some memory optimization techniques that force object
    destruction notwithstanding the circular references. Which could mean
    refactoring out the circular references.

  + Implement arbitrary piping system.

  + Consider refactoring some of the flexibility at the SvnCommand::prepare()
    level - it's now seeming difficult to imagine a use case where that's really
    necessary, as most things can be accomplished indirectly using execute() and
    clear().
